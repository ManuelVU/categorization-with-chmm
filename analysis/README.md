# Data Analysis

Files in this directory make use of functions in `~/src` to model the data in 
`~/data` using the Coupled Hidden Markov Model approach to categorization. The
output of the chains is saved in the `~/data/posterior-samples/` directory which 
is used by plotting functions found in the `~/figures` path.
