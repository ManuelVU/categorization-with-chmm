# Source code

Files in this section include independent functions used to generate data files
and sampling methods used in the data analysis of this project. Functions are 
used by files in the `app` directory.

----

- Need a function that can pull from condition type 6 in Lewandovsky (2011) and 
save them with the same format as a `.csv` file, this format has to be common so 
that the functions used for sampling don't have to change depending on the 
experiment.

- I need a function that can take the properties of the stimulus in each 
experiment and generate a similarity matrix. I think this will be
experiment dependent but it can be saved as a data file in a new directory.
