# Data organization and usage

This directory contains the data used in this project in two formats, Matlab 
(original format `.mat`) and a comma separated format (`.csv`) which is used by 
the functions in `src`.

## Followig steps

- Missing files for all and type 6 from lewandowsky.

- Similarity metrics could also be stored as data but not sure they should be 
with the rest of the files. I could add a different directory and save into it
using another function.
