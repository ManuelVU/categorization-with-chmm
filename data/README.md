# Data organization and usage

This directory contains the data used in this project in two formats, Matlab 
(original format `.mat`) and a comma separated format (`.csv`) which is used by 
the functions in `src`.

## Followig steps

- The only files that we need here are the ones from Lee and Navarro
(2002) and from condition type 6 in Lewandovsky (2011) in both .mat and .csv
files.

- Similarity metrics could also be stored as data but not sure they should be 
with the rest of the files. I could add a different directory and save into it
using another function
