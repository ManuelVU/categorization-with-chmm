## A Coupled Hidden Markov Model Framework for Measuring the Dynamics of Categorization

This repository contains data, code and figures from the paper "A coupled hidden Markov model framework for measuring the dynamics of categorization". A pre-print version of this paper can be found at: [PsyArXive](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/76g4d/). 

This repository is organized as follows:

- `data/` contains raw data files, clean data files, stimulus features and posterior samples. **Note:** posterior samples have been omitted from the repository, but will be saved in their corresponding directory once the code is run.

- `src/` contains functions that deal with data parsing, summaries, simulation, similarity, sampling and plots.

- `analysis/` contains code used for evaluating participants, sampling and drawing figures presented in the paper.

- `figures/` contains the figures used in the paper alongside additional plots of all participants.
